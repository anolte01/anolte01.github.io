    <h1> About me </h1>
    <p> I'm a sophomore double major in Computer Science and Math at Tufts University. I work as a teaching assistant for programming languages (Comp 105) and am searching for an internship for summer 2017 in software engineering. I grew up in Maryland and now live in the Boston area.

    <p> I have always been drawn to problems that make me not just use what I know, but force me to create something new. I love using Math to explore deep, beautiful, and applicable systems. In particular, as an undergraduate, I've loved the proof-based, exploratory structure of Analysis. And I have enjoyed learning through my studies in Computer Science the structure and tradeoffs that problem-solving frameworks make. Within computer science, I've had a lot of fun with functional programming, and things like mutual recursion. Within computer science, I've had a lot of fun with functional progamming, and things like <a href="mutual_rec1.html"> mutual recursion </a>.
