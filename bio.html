    <h1> About me </h1>
    <p> I'm a sophomore double major in Computer Science and Math at Tufts University. I work as a teaching assistant for programming languages (Comp 105) and am searching for an internship for summer 2017 doing software engineering in the Boston area.
    </p>
    
    <p> I have always been drawn to problems that make me not just use what I know, but force me to create something new. I love using Math to explore deep, beautiful, and applicable systems. In particular, as an undergraduate, I've loved the proof-based, exploratory structure of Analysis. And I have enjoyed learning through my studies in Computer Science the structure and tradeoffs that problem-solving frameworks make.
